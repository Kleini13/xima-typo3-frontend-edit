What does it do?
================

This extension provides an edit button for editors within frontend content elements.

    :alt: Frontend Edit Preview

The extension has been developed to provide a simple and lightweight solution to easily start the editing of content elements from the frontend and thus reduce the gap between frontend and backend. Therefore a simple javascript is injected into the frontend, which generates action links to the TYPO3 backend with the corresponding edit views.

..  note::
    This is **not** a further development of the "original" extension `frontend_editing <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/frontend_editing>`_. It is similar in some ways to the realisation of the `feedit <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/feedit>`_ extension. This extension is an independent implementation with a different approach.
