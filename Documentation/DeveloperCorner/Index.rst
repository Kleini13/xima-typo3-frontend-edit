Two opportunities exists to extend the dropdown menu with custom entries:

- Use an :ref:`event <events>` to modify the menu directly
- Use a :ref:`viewhelper <data-attributes>` to extend the menu with data entries

Additionally, you can provide a :ref:`custom css <custom-styling>` file to adjust the styling.
